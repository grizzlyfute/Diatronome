# Required permissions
* Audio record (for tuner function).

# Known issues
* The tuner use a custom algorithm based on envelop detector. The accuracy may vary depending on your device brand or your instrument. In some cases, alternative methods like Fourier spectral analysis or Yin detection might be more suitable.
* Minor glitches may occurs when using note player, due to abrupt wave stops causing signal distortion.
* AudioTrack may not works properly on Android virtual device.
